# Linker Config

# Config... how will portals be stored in code? sorted by x
# coordinate? What is a resource-efficient way of getting all portals
#within an x-y range

# Don't store them by coordinate, just use a list (or custom class
# with a list) but...
# When reading them in, check with every previous portal whether it is
# in range (i.e. a candidate to be linked to) and store a reference to
# the other portal in each.
# Hm... this is still O(n^2)... I might need an R*-tree or something.
# Should I start with this simple version and see if it's slow in
# testing? I don't want to prematurely optimise
